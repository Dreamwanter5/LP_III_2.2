# Linguagem de Programação - 2º Ano, 2º Semestre

## Introduction

Welcome! This repository serves as a personal archive of programming exercises I completed during the second semester of my second year in school (2023). It's a collection of my learning journey, preserving the work I did as I was developing my programming skills.

## Purpose

This repository is primarily for **personal learning and reference**. It contains old school exercises that I've kept to:
- Track my progress over time
- Revisit concepts and solutions when needed
- Maintain a record of my educational journey

## Course Content

During this semester, I focused on:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Learning fundamental OOP concepts and principles
- **Java**: Continuing to develop proficiency in Java as the primary programming language
- **NetBeans IDE**: Starting to use NetBeans for development

## Note

The code in this repository reflects my learning at that particular time and may not represent current best practices or my current skill level. It's kept as-is for historical and personal reference purposes.
